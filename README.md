# battleship_game
A very easy to play JavaScript game. You can either click on the grid cells to guess a ship's location or you can pick a cell row/column and type it into the input field.

There are 3 ships to sink and they are randomly generated, they will be either positioned vertcal or horizontal on the grid and a ship length is 3 grid cell. This game was inspired from the book "Head First Javascript" which I've improved, heavily refactored and added many features.
